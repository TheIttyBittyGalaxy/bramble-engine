// ENTITY COMPONENT SYSTEM COMPONENT //
class Component {
  /*:: entityComponentSystem
  A component stores data about an aspect of an entity. Components should only contain data, and no functionality.
  In practise, this means that component classes are primarily composed of attributes, getters, and setters, and may also have some methods for utility. Typically, they should not contain methods that contain game logic however.
