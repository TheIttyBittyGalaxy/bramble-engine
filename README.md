# Bramble - A game engine for JavaScript web games
Bramble is a small game engine I am developing so I can use it in game jams. __(Hence the name, get it? Bramble? Like bramble jam - game jam? Anyway...)__

## Key features
* Game states are represented by objects
* The engine implements an Entity Component System
* The engine implements an asset loading system

## Can I help?
Sure! If you've spent long enough on the internet to find this little corner of it, you must need something to do! Jump onto the development branch to see where I'm at at the moment.
