# Bramble - A game engine for JavaScript web games
Bramble is a small game engine I am developing so I can use it in game jams. __(Hence the name, get it? Bramble? Like bramble jam - game jam? Anyway...)__

## Key features
* Game states are represented by objects
* The engine implements an Entity Component System
* The engine implements an asset loading system

## Can I help?
Sure thing! If you've got a contribution you want to make feel free to post an issue to reach out to me, or just fork the project and get going!
